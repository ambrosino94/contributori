# Contributori Landing Page

This website serves as a landing page for a stunning 3D resin replica of a real monument located at Via Italia in Panama. The monument is an homage to the Italian ancestors and the rich Italian heritage present in the country. It was donated to the city by the first official commune of Italian immigrant residents.

## About the Monument

The Contributori monument replica is a work of art meticulously crafted with utmost attention to detail. It was entirely modeled in Shapr3D, a powerful 3D modeling software, bringing the essence of the original monument to life in a digital environment.

The digital model was then sliced using Lychee Slicer, ensuring precise layering and accurate reproduction during the printing process. Created in two different sizes for a local event commemorating the monument and the Panamanian-Italian history.

The first production batch was made as a donation to the event, driven by the fact that I am a direct descendant of one of the members of the commune that donated the real monument.

To create an exquisite finish, the monument was printed in Pearl White Creality Resin, lending it an elegant marble-like appearance. Each piece was carefully processed by hand to achieve a smooth texture and refined aesthetic. Additional parts were printed using an FDM printer and meticulously attached by hand, adding intricate details and enhancing the overall presentation.

Each replica of the monument features a QR code. The smaller replicas have a sticker QR code, while the larger ones have a resin 3D printed QR code on the base as a plaque. Scanning the QR code takes you to this website, where you can explore the names and pictures of all the original contributors who made the original monument possible.

## Website Design
